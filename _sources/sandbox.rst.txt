#################
Sandbox Testcases
#################

The sandbox contains a list of test cases meant to assist you in
implementation.

It is also the intension that you can use the sandbox for automatic integration
testing of your service. We will not modify individual test cases and will
deprecate them with a sufficient grace period, if need be.

The 3-D Secure server sandbox validates input according to the specification.

*************
Generic Tests
*************

Unrecognized BIN
""""""""""""""""

Test that your system handles account numbers that are not enrolled.

Procedure:
  1. Send :ref:`preauth input <preauth-input>` using an account number between
     ``9000100149672445`` and ``9000100158669649``.

Nominal response:
  A :ref:`not enrolled <not_enrolled>` response.

Success criteria:
  Your system handles the :ref:`not enrolled <not_enrolled>` response.

*************
Browser Tests
*************

These tests involve ``deviceChannel: 02``. This must be set in all
authentication requests.

3DS Method timeout
""""""""""""""""""

Test that your system handles 3DS Methods that time out.  Your system should
correctly set ``threeDSCompInd`` to ``N`` in the ``/auth`` call, after a timed
out 3DS Method call.

Procedure:
  Use an account number between ``9000100434274192`` and ``9000100458973304``.

     superfluous.
